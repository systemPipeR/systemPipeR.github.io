  abstract = "High-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq or
              barcode counting provide quantitative readouts in the form of
              count data. To infer differential signal in such data correctly
              and with good statistical power, estimation of data variability
              throughout the dynamic range and a suitable error model are
              required. We propose a method based on the negative binomial
              distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression
              and present an implementation, DESeq, as an R/Bioconductor
              package.",
