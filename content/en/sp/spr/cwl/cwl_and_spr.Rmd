## How to connect CWL description files within _`systemPipeR`_ 

This section will demonstrate how to connect CWL parameters files to create 
workflows. In addition, we will show how the workflow can be easily scalable 
with _`systemPipeR`_.

`SYSargsList` container stores all the information and instructions needed for processing 
a set of input files with a single or many command-line steps within a workflow 
(i.e. several components of the software or several independent software tools). 
The `SYSargsList` object is created and fully populated with the `SYSargsList` construct
function. 
Full documentation of `SYSargsList` management instances can be found [here](/sp/spr/introduction/#workflow-management-with-sysargslist)
and [here](/sp/spr/sp_run/step_interactive/#adding-the-first-step).

The following imports a `.cwl` file (here `example.cwl`) for running the `echo Hello World!` 
example.

```{r fromFile, eval=TRUE}
HW <- SYSargsList(wf_file = "example/workflow_example.cwl", 
                  input_file = "example/example_single.yml", 
                  dir_path = system.file("extdata/cwl", package = "systemPipeR"))
HW
cmdlist(HW)
```

However, we are limited to run just one command-line or one sample in this example. 
To scale the command-line over many samples, a simple solution offered by `systemPipeR` 
is to provide a `variable` for each of the parameters that we want to run with multiple samples. 

Let's explore the example:

```{r}
dir_path <- system.file("extdata/cwl", package = "systemPipeR")
yml <- yaml::read_yaml(file.path(dir_path, "example/example.yml"))
yml
```

For the `message` and `SampleName` parameter, we are passing a variable connecting 
with a third file called `targets.` 

Now, let's explore the `targets` file structure:

```{r}
targetspath <- system.file("extdata/cwl/example/targets_example.txt", package = "systemPipeR")
read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = "#")
```

The `targets` file defines all input files or values and sample ids of an analysis workflow. 
For this example, we have defined a string message for the `echo` command-line tool,
in the first column that will be evaluated, and the second column is the 
`SampleName` id for each one of the messages.
Any number of additional columns can be added as needed.

Users should note here, the usage of `targets` files is optional when using 
`systemPipeR's` new CWL interface. Since for organizing experimental variables targets 
files are extremely useful and user-friendly. Thus, we encourage users to keep using them.

### How to connect the parameter files and `targets` file information?

The constructor function creates an `SYSargsList` S4 class object connecting three input files:

  - CWL command-line specification file (`wf_file` argument);
  - Input variables (`input_file` argument);
  - Targets file (`targets` argument).
    
As demonstrated above, the latter is optional for workflow steps lacking input files. 
The connection between input variables (here defined by `input_file` argument) 
and the `targets` file are defined under the `inputvars` argument. 
A named vector is required, where each element name needs to match with column 
names in the `targets` file, and the value must match the names of the *.yml* 
variables. This is used to replace the CWL variable and construct all the command-line
for that particular step. 

The variable pattern `_XXXX_` is used to distinguish CWL variables that target 
columns will replace. This pattern is recommended for consistency and easy identification
but not enforced.

The following imports a `.cwl` file (same example demonstrated above) for running
the `echo Hello World` example. However, now we are connecting the variable defined 
on the `.yml` file with the `targets` file inputs.

```{r fromFile_example, eval=TRUE}
HW_mul <- SYSargsList(step_name = "echo", 
                      targets=targetspath, 
                      wf_file="example/workflow_example.cwl", input_file="example/example.yml", 
                      dir_path = dir_path, 
                      inputvars = c(Message = "_STRING_", SampleName = "_SAMPLE_"))
HW_mul
cmdlist(HW_mul)
```

## Creating the CWL param files 

In the next two sections, we will discuss how to use `createParam` from SPR 
to create CWL param files. In `createParam`, there are two versions of syntax:

1. [version 1](../create_param_v1): pseudo-bash script format, easy to write
1. [version 2](../create_param_v2): `;` separated format, has more rules, but support 
   a lot more functionalities. 


## Contribute new CWL files to _`systemPipeR`_

_`systemPipeR`_ organizes a collection of [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) CommandLineTool and 
Workflow descriptions for a variety of applications, that can be 
found on Github [cwl_collection](https://github.com/systemPipeR/cwl_collection). 

If you have new cwl files would like to add to this collection, submit a 
[pull request](https://github.com/systemPipeR/cwl_collection/pulls).

After adding, new files will automatically trigger a
push to [*systemPipeRdata* (SPRdata)](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata) 
and [*systemPipeR* (SPR)](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeR) repositories master branch
shortly.
