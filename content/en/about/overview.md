systemPipe (SP) is a generic toolkit for designing and running reproducible data 
analysis workflows. The environment consists of three major modules implemented
as R/Bioconductor packages.

- _systemPipeR_ (SPR) provides core functionalities for defining workflows, 
interacting with command-line software, and executing both R and/or command-line 
software, as well as generating publication-quality analysis reports. 

- _systemPipeShiny_ (SPS) integrates a graphical user interface for managing 
workflows and visualizing results interactively. 

- _systemPipeWorkflow_ (SPW) offers a collection of pre-configured workflow templates.

 ### Availability

All the packages are freely available for all common operating systems from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/systemPipeR).
