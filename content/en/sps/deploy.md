## How to deploy the application

Among several options of deployment of your `SPS` custom application, here you can find the example of [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 
To get started, it is required to create a *shinyapps.io* account. Please follow this [tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html) 
with all the instructions to create an account. 
`SPS` project provides a ready-to-use file, `deploy.R`, with the required information to configure ShinyApps account and deploy the application.

Once the account is set correctly, you can deploy it as soon as the project is created. It 
is recommended to create -> test/run -> deploy a Shiny app from Rstudio and follow 
[this tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html).
