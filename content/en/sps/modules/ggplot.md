## Quick {ggplot} module

This module enables you to quickly upload datasets and make a {[ggplot{blk}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)} 
in a second by using some functionalities from {[Esquisse{blk}](https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/index.html)}.

### Upload data

1. The first thing you come to this module is to upload a tabular data file. You
   can choose to use the example or upload your own. The example is just the `iris`
   data.
    - 1.1. If you choose to upload, there will be a upload button where you need to 
      choose your own file.
2. By default, it assumes you upload a ".csv" file with "#" as comments. If not 
   you can choose the file delimiter and comment character.
3. You can view your uploaded data and use the boxes below each column name to 
   perform some filters, but you are not allowed to edit the data.
4. If everything looks good, you can submit to proceed to the plot making panel.
