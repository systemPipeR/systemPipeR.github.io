  abstract = "The reprogramming of gene expression is one of the key responses
              to environmental stimuli, whereas changes in mRNA do not
              necessarily bring forth corresponding changes of the protein,
              which seems partially due to the stress-induced selective
              translation. To address this issue, we systematically compared
              the transcriptome and translatome using self-produced and
              publicly available datasets to decipher how and to what extent
              the coordination and discordance between transcription and
              translation came to be in response to wounding (self-produced),
              dark to light transition, heat, hypoxia, Pi starvation and the
              pathogen-associated molecular pattern (elf18) in Arabidopsis. We
              found that changes in total mRNAs (transcriptome) and
              ribosome-protected fragments (translatome) are highly correlated
              upon dark to light transition or heat stress. However, this close
              correlation was generally lost under other four stresses analyzed
              in this study, especially during immune response, which suggests
              that transcription and translation are differentially coordinated
              under distinct stress conditions. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO)
              enrichment analysis showed that typical stress responsive genes
              were upregulated at both transcriptional and translational
              levels, while non-stress-specific responsive genes were changed
              solely at either level or downregulated at both levels. Taking
              wounding responsive genes for example, typical stress responsive
              genes are generally involved in functional categories related to
              dealing with the deleterious effects caused by the imposed
              wounding stress, such as response to wounding, response to water
              deprivation and response to jasmonic acid, whereas
              non-stress-specific responsive genes are often enriched in
              functional categories like S-glycoside biosynthetic process,
              photosynthesis and DNA-templated transcription. Collectively, our
              results revealed the differential as well as targeted
              coordination between transcriptome and translatome in response to
              diverse stresses, thus suggesting a potential model wherein
              preferential ribosome loading onto the stress-upregulated mRNA
              pool could be a pacing factor for selective translation.",

  abstract = "Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that has
              the remarkable ability to infect and replicate in neutrophils,
              immune cells with an arsenal of antimicrobial effector
              mechanisms. We report that T. gondii infection extends the life
              span of primary human peripheral blood neutrophils by delaying
              spontaneous apoptosis, serum starvation-induced apoptosis, and
              tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-$\alpha$)-mediated apoptosis. T. gondii
              blockade of apoptosis was associated with an inhibition of
              processing and activation of the apoptotic caspases caspase-8 and
              -3, decreased phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane,
              and reduced cell death. We performed a global transcriptome
              analysis of T. gondii-infected peripheral blood neutrophils using
              RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and identified gene expression changes
              associated with DNA replication and DNA repair pathways, which in
              mature neutrophils are indicative of changes in regulators of
              cell survival. Consistent with the RNA-Seq data, T. gondii
              infection upregulated transcript and protein expression of PCNA,
              which is found in the cytosol of human neutrophils, where it
              functions as a key inhibitor of apoptotic pro-caspases. Infection
              of neutrophils resulted in increased interaction of PCNA with
              pro-caspase-3. Inhibition of this interaction with an AlkB
              homologue 2 PCNA-interacting motif (APIM) peptide reversed the
              infection-induced delay in cell death. Taken together, these
              findings indicate a novel strategy by which T. gondii manipulates
              cell life span in primary human neutrophils, which may allow the
              parasite to maintain an intracellular replicative niche and avoid
              immune clearance.IMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii is an obligate
              intracellular parasite that can cause life-threatening disease in
              immunocompromised individuals and in the developing fetus.
              Interestingly, T. gondii has evolved strategies to successfully
              manipulate the host immune system to establish a productive
              infection and evade host defense mechanisms. Although it is well
              documented that neutrophils are mobilized during acute T. gondii
              infection and infiltrate the site of infection, these cells can
              also be actively infected by T. gondii and serve as a replicative
              niche for the parasite. However, there is a limited understanding
              of the molecular processes occurring within T. gondii-infected
              neutrophils. This study reveals that T. gondii extends the life
              span of human neutrophils by inducing the expression of PCNA,
              which prevents activation of apoptotic caspases, thus delaying
              apoptosis. This strategy may allow the parasite to preserve its
              replicative intracellular niche.",

              an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute
              respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent
              discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on
              identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of
              administration, and time to reach peak immunity against
              SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting
              vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the
              licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the
              SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein
              (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM)
              with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10
              days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast,
              intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity
              and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals.
              While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody
              titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular
              immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by
              revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune
              transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals

              is accomplished by dedicated chaperone and/or remodeling

              complexes of many human H2A variants by using mass spectrometry,
              we also found additional members of the known H2A.Z chaperone
              complexes p400/TIP60/NuA4 and SRCAP. We discovered JAZF1, a
              nuclear/nucleolar protein, as a member of a p400 sub-complex
              containing MBTD1 but excluding ANP32E. Depletion of JAZF1 results

              Since JAZF1 associates with the histone acetyltransferase TIP60,
              whose depletion causes a correlated H2A.Z deacetylation of
              several JAZF1-targeted enhancer regions, we speculate that JAZF1

  abstract = "Amino sugars, particularly glucosamine (GlcN) and
              N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), are abundant carbon and nitrogen
              sources supplied in host secretions and in the diet to the
              biofilms colonizing the human oral cavity. Evidence is emerging
              that these amino sugars provide ecological advantages to
              beneficial commensals over oral pathogens and pathobionts. Here,
              we performed transcriptome analysis on Streptococcus mutans and
              Streptococcus gordonii growing in single-species or dual-species
              cultures with glucose, GlcN, or GlcNAc as the primary
              carbohydrate source. Compared to glucose, GlcN caused drastic
              transcriptomic shifts in each species of bacteria when it was
              cultured alone. Likewise, cocultivation in the presence of GlcN
              yielded transcriptomic profiles that were dramatically different
              from the single-species results from GlcN-grown cells. In
              contrast, GlcNAc elicited only minor changes in the transcriptome
              of either organism in single- and dual-species cultures.
              Interestingly, genes involved in pyruvate metabolism were among
              the most significantly affected by GlcN in both species, and
              these changes were consistent with measurements of pyruvate in
              culture supernatants. Differing from what was found in a previous
              report, growth of S. mutans alone with GlcN inhibited the
              expression of multiple operons required for mutacin production.
              Cocultivation with S. gordonii consistently increased the
              expression of two manganese transporter operons (slo and mntH)
              and decreased expression of mutacin genes in S. mutans
              Conversely, S. gordonii appeared to be less affected by the
              presence of S. mutans but did show increases in genes for
              biosynthetic processes in the cocultures. In conclusion, amino
              sugars profoundly alter the interactions between pathogenic and
              commensal streptococci by reprogramming central
              metabolism.IMPORTANCE Carbohydrate metabolism is central to the
              development of dental caries. A variety of sugars available to
              dental microorganisms influence the development of caries by
              affecting the physiology, ecology, and pathogenic potential of
              tooth biofilms. Using two well-characterized oral bacteria, one
              pathogen (Streptococcus mutans) and one commensal (Streptococcus
              gordonii), in an RNA deep-sequencing analysis, we studied the
              impact of two abundant amino sugars on bacterial gene expression
              and interspecies interactions. The results indicated large-scale
              remodeling of gene expression induced by GlcN in particular,
              affecting bacterial energy generation, acid production, protein
              synthesis, and release of antimicrobial molecules. Our study
              provides novel insights into how amino sugars modify bacterial
              behavior, information that will be valuable in the design of new
              technologies to detect and prevent oral infectious diseases.",

              footprints across individual transcripts. While many

              novel approach together with an R package, RiboDiPA, for
              Differential Pattern Analysis of Ribo-seq data. RiboDiPA allows

              downy mildew (DM), caused by the obligate biotroph
              Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Whereas DM in cucumber was previously
              efficiently controlled by the dm-1 gene from Indian cucumber
              accession PI 197087, this resistance was broken by new DM
              strains, prompting the search for novel sources of resistance. A
              promising source of resistance is the wild cucumber accession PI
              197088. It was previously shown that DM resistance in this
              genotype inherits polygenically. In this paper, we put the focus
              on one of the QTL, DM4.1 that is located on chromosome 4. QTL
              DM4.1 was shown to consist of three subQTL: DM4.1.1 affected
              pathogen-induced necrosis, DM4.1.2 was shown to have an additive
              effect on sporulation, and DM4.1.3 had a recessive effect on
              chlorosis as well as an effect on sporulation. Near-isogenic
              lines (NILs) were produced by introgressing the subQTLs into a
              susceptible cucumber line (HS279) with good horticultural traits.
              Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many genes in general, and
              defense pathway genes in particular, were differentially
              expressed in NIL DM4.1.1/.2 compared to NIL DM4.1.3 and the
              susceptible parent HS279. This indicates that the resistance from
              subQTL DM4.1.1 and/or subQTL DM4.1.2 likely involves defense
              signaling pathways, whereas resistance due to subQTL DM4.1.3 is
              more likely to be independent of known defense pathways. Based on
              fine-mapping data, we identified the RLK gene CsLRK10L2 as a
              likely candidate for subQTL DM4.1.2, as this gene was found to
              have a loss-of-function mutation in the susceptible parent HS279,
              and was strongly upregulated by P. cubensis inoculation in NIL
              DM4.1.1/.2. Heterologous expression of this gene triggered
              necrosis, providing further evidence that this gene is indeed
              causal for subQTL DM4.1.2.",

  abstract = "The oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato
              and tomato blight, expresses two extracellular invertases. Unlike
              typical fungal invertases, the P. infestans genes are not sucrose
              induced or glucose repressed but instead appear to be under
              developmental control. Transcript levels of both genes were very
              low in mycelia harvested from artificial medium but high in
              preinfection stages (sporangia, zoospores, and germinated cysts),
              high during biotrophic growth in leaves and tubers, and low
              during necrotrophy. Genome-wide analyses of metabolic enzymes and
              effectors indicated that this expression profile was fairly
              unusual, matched only by a few other enzymes, such as carbonic
              anhydrases and a few RXLR effectors. Genes for other metabolic
              enzymes were typically downregulated in the preinfection stages.
              Overall metabolic gene expression during the necrotrophic stage
              of infection clustered with artificial medium, while the
              biotrophic phase formed a separate cluster. Confocal microscopy
              of transformants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
              fusions indicated that invertase protein resided primarily in
              haustoria during infection. This localization was not
              attributable to haustorium-specific promoter activity. Instead,
              the N-terminal regions of proteins containing signal peptides
              were sufficient to deliver proteins to haustoria. Invertase
              expression during leaf infection was linked to a decline in
              apoplastic sucrose, consistent with a role of the enzymes in
              plant pathogenesis. This was also suggested by the discovery that
              invertase genes occur across multiple orders of oomycetes but not
              in most animal pathogens or a mycoparasite.IMPORTANCE Oomycetes
              cause hundreds of diseases in economically and environmentally
              significant plants. How these microbes acquire host nutrients is
              not well understood. Many oomycetes insert specialized hyphae
              called haustoria into plant cells, but unlike their fungal
              counterparts, a role in nutrition has remained unproven. The
              discovery that Phytophthora invertases localize to haustoria
              provides the first strong evidence that these structures
              participate in feeding. Since regions of proteins containing
              signal peptides targeted proteins to the haustorium-plant
              interface, haustoria appear to be the primary machinery for
              secreting proteins during biotrophic pathogenesis. Although
              oomycete invertases were acquired laterally from fungi, their
              expression patterns have adapted to the Phytophthora lifestyle by
              abandoning substrate-level regulation in favor of developmental
              control, allowing the enzymes to be produced in anticipation of
              plant colonization. This study highlights how a widely
              distributed hydrolytic enzyme has evolved new behaviors in
              oomycetes.",

              tissue was collected from 24 freshwater juvenile Chinook salmon
              (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), held in normoxia [dissolved oxygen
              (DO) > 8 mg L-1] and hypoxia (DO = 4-5 mg L-1) in 10 and 18°

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ribosome profiling has been widely used for studies
              of translation under a large variety of cellular and
              physiological contexts. Many of these studies have greatly
              benefitted from a series of data-mining tools designed for
              dissection of the translatome from different aspects. However, as
              the studies of translation advance quickly, the current toolbox
              still falls in short, and more specialized tools are in urgent
              need for deeper and more efficient mining of the important and
              new features of the translation landscapes. RESULTS: Here, we
              present RiboMiner, a bioinformatics toolset for mining of
              multi-dimensional features of the translatome with ribosome
              profiling data. RiboMiner performs extensive quality assessment
              of the data and integrates a spectrum of tools for various
              metagene analyses of the ribosome footprints and for detailed
              analyses of multiple features related to translation regulation.
              Visualizations of all the results are available. Many of these
              analyses have not been provided by previous methods. RiboMiner is
              highly flexible, as the pipeline could be easily adapted and
              customized for different scopes and targets of the studies.
              CONCLUSIONS: Applications of RiboMiner on two published datasets
              did not only reproduced the main results reported before, but
              also generated novel insights into the translation regulation
              processes. Therefore, being complementary to the current tools,
              RiboMiner could be a valuable resource for dissections of the
              translation landscapes and the translation regulations by mining
              the ribosome profiling data more comprehensively and with higher
              resolution. RiboMiner is freely available at

              a MKL1 variant devoid of the actin-binding domain (MKL1

              quantification of specific mRNAs extracted from polysomes and
              western blots. Results: Our results reveal the expression
              profiles of a luminal to basal-like state in accordance with an
              epithelial to mesenchymal transition. During the transition, the
              synthesis of ribosomal proteins and that of many translational
              factors was upregulated. This overexpression of the translational
              machinery appears to be regulated at the translational level. Our
              results indicate an increase of ribosome biogenesis and
              translation activity. We detected an extensive metabolic rewiring
              occurring in an already ``Warburg-like'' context, in which enzyme
              isoform switches and metabolic shunts indicate a crucial role of
              HIF-1$\alpha$ along with other master regulatory factors.
              Furthermore, we detected a decrease in the expression of enzymes
              involved in ribonucleotide synthesis from the pentose phosphate
              pathway. During this transition, cells increase in size,
              downregulate genes associated with proliferation, and strongly
              upregulate expression of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix
              genes. Conclusions: Our study reveals multiple regulatory events
              associated with metabolic and translational machinery adaptation
              during an epithelial mesenchymal-like transition process. During
              this major cellular transition, cells achieve a new homeostatic
              state ensuring their survival. This work shows that ribosome
              profiling complemented with RNA-Seq is a powerful approach to
              unveil in-depth global adaptive cellular responses and the
              interconnection among regulatory circuits, which will be helpful
              for identification of new therapeutic targets.",

              between two loci associated with flooding survival in rice (Oryza
              sativa L.). ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 (AG1), encoding trehalose
              6-phosphate phosphatase 7 (TPP7), promotes mobilization of
              endosperm reserves to enhance the elongation of a hollow
              coleoptile in seeds that are seeded directly into shallow
              paddies. SUBMERGENCE 1 (SUB1), encoding the ethylene-responsive
              transcription factor SUB1A-1, confers tolerance to complete
              submergence by dampening carbohydrate catabolism, to enhance
              recovery upon desubmergence. Interactions between AG1/TPP7 and
              SUB1/SUB1A-1 were investigated under three flooding scenarios
              using four near-isogenic lines by surveying growth and survival.
              Pyramiding of the two loci does not negatively affect anaerobic
              germination or vegetative-stage submergence tolerance. However,
              the pyramided AG1 SUB1 genotype displays reduced survival when
              seeds are planted underwater and maintained under submergence for
              16 d. To better understand the roles of TPP7 and SUB1A-1 and
              their interaction, temporal changes in carbohydrates and shoot
              transcriptomes were monitored in the four genotypes varying at
              the two loci at four developmental timeponts, from day 2 after
              seeding through day 14 of complete submergence. TPP7 enhances
              early coleoptile elongation, whereas SUB1A-1 promotes precocious
              photoautotrophy and then restricts underwater elongation. By
              contrast, pyramiding of the AG1 and SUB1 slows elongation growth,
              the transition to photoautotrophy, and survival. mRNA-sequencing
              highlights time-dependent and genotype-specific regulation of

              modification, plastid biogenesis, carbohydrate catabolism and
              transport, elongation growth, and other processes. These results

              reduce disulfide bonds in target proteins. The class III GRX gene
              family is unique to land plants, and Arabidopsis thaliana has 21
              class III GRXs, which remain largely uncharacterized. About 80\%
              of A. thaliana class III GRXs are transcriptionally regulated by
              nitrate, and several recent studies have suggested roles for
              these GRXs in nitrogen signaling. Our objective was to
              functionally characterize two nitrate-induced GRX genes, AtGRXS5
              and AtGRXS8, defining their roles in signaling and development in
              the A. thaliana root. We demonstrated that AtGRXS5 and AtGRXS8
              are primarily expressed in root and shoot vasculature (phloem),
              and that the corresponding GRX proteins display nucleo-cytosolic
              subcellular localization. Ectopic expression of AtGRXS8 in
              transgenic plants caused major alterations in root system
              architecture: Normal primary root development, but a near absence
              of lateral roots. RNA sequencing demonstrated that the roots of
              AtGRXS8-overexpressing plants show strongly reduced transcript
              abundance for many primary nitrate response genes, including the
              major high-affinity nitrate transporters. Correspondingly,
              high-affinity nitrate uptake and the transport of nitrate from
              roots to shoots are compromised in AtGRXS8-overexpressing plants.
              Finally, we demonstrated that the AtGRXS8 protein can physically
              interact with the TGA1 and TGA4 transcription factors, which are
              central regulators of early transcriptional responses to nitrate
              in A. thaliana roots. Overall, these results suggest that AtGRXS8
              acts to quench both transcriptional and developmental aspects of
              primary nitrate response, potentially by interfering with the
              activity of the TGA1 and TGA4 transcription factors.",

  abstract = "Ebola virus (EBOV) continues to pose a significant threat to
              human health, as evidenced by the 2013-2016 epidemic in West
              Africa and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the
              Congo. EBOV causes hemorrhagic fever, organ damage, and shock
              culminating in death, with case fatality rates as high as 90\%.
              This high lethality combined with the paucity of licensed medical
              countermeasures makes EBOV a critical human pathogen. Although
              EBOV infection results in significant damage to the liver and the
              adrenal glands, little is known about the molecular signatures of
              injury in these organs. Moreover, while changes in peripheral
              blood cells are becoming increasingly understood, the host
              responses within organs and lymphoid tissues remain poorly
              characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we tracked
              longitudinal transcriptional changes in tissues collected from
              EBOV-Makona-infected cynomolgus macaques. Following infection,
              both liver and adrenal glands exhibited significant and early
              downregulation of genes involved in metabolism, coagulation,
              hormone synthesis, and angiogenesis; upregulated genes were
              associated with inflammation. Analysis of lymphoid tissues showed
              early upregulation of genes that play a role in innate immunity
              and inflammation and downregulation of genes associated with cell
              cycle and adaptive immunity. Moreover, transient activation of
              innate immune responses and downregulation of humoral immune
              responses in lymphoid tissues were confirmed with flow cytometry.
              Together, these data suggest that the liver, adrenal gland, and
              lymphatic organs are important sites of EBOV infection and that
              dysregulating the function of these vital organs contributes to
              the development of Ebola virus disease.IMPORTANCE Ebola virus
              (EBOV) remains a high-priority pathogen since it continues to
              cause outbreaks with high case fatality rates. Although it is
              well established that EBOV results in severe organ damage, our
              understanding of tissue injury in the liver, adrenal glands, and
              lymphoid tissues remains limited. We begin to address this
              knowledge gap by conducting longitudinal gene expression studies
              in these tissues, which were collected from EBOV-infected
              cynomolgus macaques. We report robust and early gene expression
              changes within these tissues, indicating they are primary sites
              of EBOV infection. Furthermore, genes involved in metabolism,
              coagulation, and adaptive immunity were downregulated, while
              inflammation-related genes were upregulated. These results
              indicate significant tissue damage consistent with the
              development of hemorrhagic fever and lymphopenia. Our study
              provides novel insight into EBOV-host interactions and elucidates
              how host responses within the liver, adrenal glands, and lymphoid
              tissues contribute to EBOV pathogenesis.",

              conserved long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in myeloid and
              neural differentiation that is deregulated in acute myeloid
              leukemia and other cancers. Previous studies focused on the
              nuclear unspliced HOTAIRM1 transcript, however cytoplasmic splice
              variants exist whose roles have remained unknown. Here, we report
              novel functions of HOTAIRM1 in the kidney. HOTAIRM1 transcripts
              are induced during renal lineage differentiation of embryonic
              stem cells and required for expression of specific renal
              differentiation genes. We show that the major HOTAIRM1 transcript
              in differentiated cells is the spliced cytoplasmic HM1-3 isoform
              and that HM1-3 is downregulated in >90\% of clear cell renal cell
              carcinomas (ccRCCs). Knockdown of HM1-3 in renal cells
              deregulates hypoxia-responsive and angiogenic genes, including
              ANGPTL4. Furthermore, HOTAIRM1 transcripts are downregulated by
              hypoxia-mimetic stress and knockdown of the cytoplasmic HM1-3
              isoform in normoxic cells post-transcriptionally induces
              Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1$\alpha$) protein, a key
              activator of ANGPTL4. Our results demonstrate the pervasive
              downregulation of the specific HOTAIRM1 cytoplasmic isoform HM1-3
              in ccRCC and suggest possible roles of HOTAIRM1 in kidney

              the information in a manually curated Protist Interaction

              interactions from ~500 publications, spanning the last 150 years.
              All major protistan lineages were involved in interactions as
              hosts, symbionts (mutualists and commensalists), parasites,
              predators, and/or prey. Predation was the most common interaction
              (39\% of all records), followed by symbiosis (29\%), parasitism
              (18\%), and 'unresolved interactions' (14\%, where it is
              uncertain whether the interaction is beneficial or antagonistic).
              Using bipartite networks, we found that protist predators seem to
              be 'multivorous' while parasite-host and symbiont-host

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Whiteflies are a threat to cassava (Manihot
              esculenta), an important staple food in many tropical/subtropical
              regions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating
              cassava's responses against this pest is crucial for developing
              control strategies. Pathogenesis-related (PR) protein families
              are an integral part of plant immunity. With the availability of
              whole genome sequences, the annotation and expression programs of
              the full complement of PR genes in an organism can now be
              achieved. An understanding of the responses of the entire
              complement of PR genes during biotic stress and to the defense
              hormones, salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), is lacking.
              Here, we analyze the responses of cassava PR genes to whiteflies,
              SA, JA, and other biotic aggressors. RESULTS: The cassava genome
              possesses 14 of the 17 plant PR families, with a total of 447 PR
              genes. A cassava PR gene nomenclature is proposed. Phylogenetic
              relatedness of cassava PR proteins to each other and to homologs
              in poplar, rice and Arabidopsis identified cassava-specific PR
              gene family expansions. The temporal programs of PR gene
              expression in response to the whitefly (Aleurotrachelus socialis)
              in four whitefly-susceptible cassava genotypes showed that 167 of
              the 447 PR genes were regulated after whitefly infestation. While
              the timing of PR gene expression varied, over 37\% of
              whitefly-regulated PR genes were downregulated in all four
              genotypes. Notably, whitefly-responsive PR genes were largely
              coordinately regulated by SA and JA. The analysis of cassava PR
              gene expression in response to five other biotic stresses
              revealed a strong positive correlation between whitefly and
              Xanthomonas axonopodis and Cassava Brown Streak Virus responses
              and negative correlations between whitefly and Cassava Mosaic
              Virus responses. Finally, certain associations between PR genes
              in cassava expansions and response to biotic stresses were
              observed among PR families. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents
              the first genome-wide characterization of PR genes in cassava. PR
              gene responses to six biotic stresses and to SA and JA are
              demonstrably different to other angiosperms. We propose that our
              approach could be applied in other species to fully understand PR
              gene regulation by pathogens, pests and the canonical defense
              hormones SA and JA.",

              endothelial cells prior to entering host tissues. However, little
              is known about the molecular interactions at the
              parasite-endothelial cell interface. We demonstrate that T.
              gondii infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial
              cells (HUVEC) altered cell morphology and dysregulated barrier
              function, increasing permeability to low-molecular-weight
              polymers. T. gondii disrupted vascular endothelial cadherin
              (VE-cadherin) and $\beta$-catenin localization to the cell
              periphery and reduced VE-cadherin protein expression. Notably, T.
              gondii infection led to reorganization of the host cytoskeleton
              by reducing filamentous actin (F-actin) stress fiber abundance
              under static and microfluidic shear stress conditions and by
              reducing planar cell polarity. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) comparing
              genome-wide transcriptional profiles of infected to uninfected
              endothelial cells revealed changes in gene expression associated
              with cell-cell adhesion, extracellular matrix reorganization, and
              cytokine-mediated signaling. In particular, genes downstream of
              Hippo signaling and the biomechanical sensor and transcriptional
              coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) were downregulated in
              infected endothelial cells. Interestingly, T. gondii infection
              activated Hippo signaling by increasing phosphorylation of LATS1,
              leading to cytoplasmic retention of YAP, and reducing YAP target
              gene expression. These findings suggest that T. gondii infection
              triggers Hippo signaling and YAP nuclear export, leading to an
              altered transcriptional profile of infected endothelial
              cells.IMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii is a foodborne parasite that
              infects virtually all warm-blooded animals and can cause severe
              disease in individuals with compromised or weakened immune
              systems. During dissemination in its infected hosts, T. gondii
              breaches endothelial barriers to enter tissues and establish the
              chronic infections underlying the most severe manifestations of
              toxoplasmosis. The research presented here examines how T. gondii
              infection of primary human endothelial cells induces changes in
              cell morphology, barrier function, gene expression, and
              mechanotransduction signaling under static conditions and under
              the physiological conditions of shear stress found in the
              bloodstream. Understanding the molecular interactions occurring
              at the interface between endothelial cells and T. gondii may
              provide insights into processes linked to parasite dissemination
              and pathogenesis.",

  author   = "Zhao, Chaoyang and Rispe, Claude and Nabity, Paul D",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: All eukaryotes share a conserved network of processes
              regulated by the proteasome and fundamental to growth,
              development, or perception of the environment, leading to complex
              but often predictable responses to stress. As a specialized
              component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the RING
              finger domain mediates protein-protein interactions and displays
              considerable versatility in regulating many physiological
              processes in plants. Many pathogenic organisms co-opt the UPS
              through RING-type E3 ligases, but little is known about how
              insects modify these integral networks to generate novel plant
              phenotypes. RESULTS: Using a combination of transcriptome
              sequencing and genome annotation of a grapevine galling species,
              Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, we identified 138 putatively secretory
              protein RING-type (SPRINGs) E3 ligases that showed structure and
              evolutionary signatures of genes under rapid evolution. Moreover,
              the majority of the SPRINGs were more expressed in the feeding
              stage than the non-feeding egg stage, in contrast to the
              non-secretory RING genes. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that
              the SPRINGs formed clusters, likely resulting from
              species-specific gene duplication and conforming to features of
              arthropod host-manipulating (effector) genes. To test the
              hypothesis that these SPRINGs evolved to manipulate cellular
              processes within the plant host, we examined SPRING interactions
              with grapevine proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. An
              insect SPRING interacted with two plant proteins, a cellulose
              synthase, CSLD5, and a ribosomal protein, RPS4B suggesting
              secretion reprograms host immune signaling, cell division, and
              stress response in favor of the insect. Plant UPS gene expression
              during gall development linked numerous processes to novel
              organogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, D. vitifoliae SPRINGs
              represent a novel gene expansion that evolved to interact with
              Vitis hosts. Thus, a pattern is emerging for gall forming insects

              Foundation, kills at an alarming rate of roughly one person per
              hour. With this study, we aimed at better understanding disease
              mechanisms and identifying minimally invasive disease biomarkers
              by profiling novel small non-coding RNAs (specifically, tRNA
              halves and YRNA fragments) in both serum and tumor tissue from
              humans. Small RNA-Sequencing identified multiple 5' tRNA halves
              and 5' YRNA fragments that displayed significant differential
              expression levels in circulation and/or tumor tissue, as compared
              to control counterparts. In addition, by implementing a
              modification of weighted gene coexpression network analysis, we
              identified an upregulated genetic module comprised of 5' tRNA
              halves and miRNAs (miRNAs were described in previous study using
              the same samples) with significant association with the cancer
              trait. By consequently implementing miRNA-overtargeting network
              analysis, the biological function of the module (and by ``guilt
              by association,'' the function of the 5' tRNA-Val-CAC-2-1 half)
              was found to involve the transcriptional targeting of specific
              genes involved in the negative regulation of the G1/S transition
              of the mitotic cell cycle. These findings suggest that 5'
              tRNA-Val-CAC-2-1 half (reduced in serum of OSCC patients and
              elevated in the tumor tissue) could potentially serve as an OSCC
              circulating biomarker and/or target for novel anticancer
              therapies. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) loss and
              mastermind-like 3 (MAML3) translocation are two clinically
              important genetic alterations that correlate with increased rates
              of metastasis in subtypes of human paraganglioma and
              pheochromocytoma (PPGL) neuroendocrine tumors. Although
              hypotheses propose that succinate accumulation after SDH loss
              poisons dioxygenases and activates pseudohypoxia and epigenomic
              hypermethylation, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms
              account for oncogenic transcriptional patterns. Additionally,
              MAML3 translocation has recently been identified as a genetic
              alteration in PPGL, but is poorly understood. We hypothesize that
              a key to understanding tumorigenesis driven by these genetic
              alterations is identification of the transcription factors
              responsible for the observed oncogenic transcriptional changes.
              METHODS: We leverage publicly-available human tumor gene
              expression profiling experiments (N = 179) to reconstruct a PPGL
              tumor-specific transcriptional network. We subsequently use the
              inferred transcriptional network to perform master regulator
              analyses nominating transcription factors predicted to control
              oncogenic transcription in specific PPGL molecular subtypes.
              Results are validated by analysis of an independent collection of
              PPGL tumor specimens (N = 188). We then perform a similar master
              regulator analysis in SDH-loss mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
              to infer aspects of SDH loss master regulator response conserved
              across species and tissue types. RESULTS: A small number of
              master regulator transcription factors are predicted to drive the
              observed subtype-specific gene expression patterns in SDH loss
              and MAML3 translocation-positive PPGL. Interestingly, although
              EPAS1 perturbation is detectible in SDH-loss and VHL-loss tumors,
              it is by no means the most potent factor driving observed
              patterns of transcriptional dysregulation. Analysis of conserved
              SDH-loss master regulators in human tumors and MEFs implicated
              ZNF423, a known modulator of retinoic acid response in
              neuroblastoma. Subsequent functional analysis revealed a blunted
              cell death response to retinoic acid in SDH-loss MEFs and blunted
              differentiation response in SDH-inhibited SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
              cells. CONCLUSIONS: The unbiased analyses presented here nominate
              specific transcription factors that are likely drivers of
              oncogenic transcription in PPGL tumors. This information has the
              potential to be exploited for targeted therapy. Additionally, the
              observation that SDH loss or inhibition results in blunted
              retinoic acid response suggests a potential developmental
              etiology for this tumor subtype.",

              translation and its regulation. A Ribo-seq experiment produces a
              snap-shot of the location and abundance of actively translating
              ribosomes within a cell's transcriptome. In practice, Ribo-seq
              data analysis can be sensitive to quality issues such as read
              length variation, low read periodicities, and contaminations with
              ribosomal and transfer RNA. Various software tools for data
              preprocessing, quality assessment, analysis, and visualization of
              Ribo-seq data have been developed. However, many of these tools
              require considerable practical knowledge of software
              applications, and often multiple different tools have to be used
              in combination with each other. RESULTS: We present riboStreamR,
              a comprehensive Ribo-seq quality control (QC) platform in the
              form of an R Shiny web application. RiboStreamR provides
              visualization and analysis tools for various Ribo-seq QC metrics,

              of thirdhand smoke (THS) activates stress and survival pathways
              in the human nasal epithelium. Objective: To evaluate gene
              expression in the nasal epithelium of nonsmoking women following
              acute inhalation of clean air and THS. Design, Setting, and
              Participants: Nasal epithelium samples were obtained from
              participants in a randomized clinical trial (2011-2015) on the
              health effects of inhaled THS. In a crossover design,
              participants were exposed, head only, to THS and to conditioned,
              filtered air in a laboratory setting. The order of exposures was
              randomized and exposures were separated by at least 21 days.
              Ribonucleic acid was obtained from a subset of 4 healthy,
              nonsmoking women. Exposures: By chance, women in the subset were
              randomized to receive clean air exposure first and THS exposure
              second. Exposures lasted 3 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              Differentially expressed genes were identified using RNA
              sequencing with a false-discovery rate less than 0.1. Results:
              Participants were 4 healthy, nonsmoking women aged 27 to 49 years
              (mean [SD] age, 42 [10.2] years) with no chronic diseases. A
              total of 389 differentially expressed genes were identified in
              nasal epithelium exposed to THS, while only 2 genes, which were
              not studied further, were affected by clean air. Enriched gene
              ontology terms associated with stress-induced mitochondrial
              hyperfusion were identified, such as respiratory electron
              transport chain (q = 2.84 $\times$ 10-3) and mitochondrial inner
              membrane (q = 7.21 $\times$ 10-6). Reactome pathway analysis
              identified terms associated with upregulation of DNA repair
              mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (q = 1.05 $\times$
              10-2). Enrichment analyses using ingenuity pathway analysis
              identified canonical pathways related to stress-induced
              mitochondrial hyperfusion (eg, increased oxidative
              phosphorylation) (P = .001), oxidative stress (eg, glutathione
              depletion phase II reactions) (P = .04), and cell survival (z
              score = 5.026). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that
              acute inhalation of THS caused cell stress that led to the
              activation of survival pathways. Some responses were consistent
              with stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion and similar to
              those demonstrated previously in vitro. These data may be
              valuable to physicians treating patients exposed to THS and may
              aid in formulating regulations for the remediation of
              THS-contaminated environments.",

              days before challenge.IMPORTANCE Ebola virus (EBOV) is the
              causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD), a deadly disease
              and major public health threat worldwide. A safe and highly
              efficacious vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine against EBOV
              is the only platform that has successfully completed phase III
              clinical trials and has been used in recent and ongoing
              outbreaks. Earlier studies showed that antibodies are the main
              mode of protection when this vaccine is administered 28 days
              before EBOV challenge. Recently, we showed this vaccine can
              provide protection when administered as early as 3 days before
              challenge and before antibodies are detected. This study seeks to
              identify the mechanisms of rapid protection, which in turn will
              pave the way for improved vaccines and therapeutics.
              Additionally, this study provides insight into host gene
              expression signatures that could provide early biomarkers to
              identify infected individuals who are at highest risk of poor
              outcomes.",

              post-transcriptional mechanisms. The broadly expressed HuR/ELAVL1
              is important for proper function of multiple immune cell types,
              and has been proposed to regulate cytokine and other mRNA 3' UTRs
              upon activation. However, this mechanism has not been previously
              dissected in stable cellular settings. In this study, HuR
              demonstrated strong anti-apoptotic and activation roles in Jurkat
              T cells. Detailed transcriptomic analysis of HuR knockout cells
              revealed a substantial negative impact on the activation program,
              coordinately preventing the expression of immune response gene
              categories, including all cytokines. Knockout cells showed a
              significant defect in IL-2 production, which was rescued upon
              reintroduction of HuR. Interestingly, the mechanism of HuR
              regulation did not involve control of the cytokine 3' UTRs: HuR
              knockout did not affect the activity of 3' UTR reporters in 293
              cells, and had no effect on IL-2 and TNF 3' UTRs in resting or
              activated Jurkats. Instead, impaired cytokine production
              corresponded with defective induction of the IL-2 promoter upon
              activation. Accordingly, upregulation of NFATC1 was also
              impaired, without 3' UTR effects. Together, these results
              indicate that HuR controls cytokine production through
              coordinated upstream pathways, and that additional mechanisms
              must be considered in investigating its function.",

              contribution of time of day and/or the clock to differential heat
              stress responses, we probed wild-type and mutants of the
              circadian clock genes CCA1, LHY, PRR7, and PRR9 following
              exposure to heat (37 °C) and moderate cold (10 °C) in the early
              morning (ZT1) and afternoon (ZT6). Thousands of genes were
              differentially expressed in response to temperature, time of day,
              and/or the clock mutation. Approximately 30\% more genes were
              differentially expressed in the afternoon compared to the
              morning, and heat stress significantly perturbed the
              transcriptome. Of the DEGs (~3000) specifically responsive to
              heat stress, ~70\% showed time of day (ZT1 or ZT6) occurrence of

  abstract = "BACKGROUNDS: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is now widely used
              in biomedical research for various applications. Processing of
              NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the
              processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However,
              rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods
              urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical
              applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer
              panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate
              customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed
              SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide
              standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing.
              RESULTS: SEQprocess was implemented in an R package with fully
              modularized steps for data processing that can be easily
              customized. Currently, six pre-customized pipelines are provided
              that can be easily executed by non-experts such as biomedical
              scientists, including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI)
              Genomic Data Commons (GDC) pipelines as well as the popularly
              used pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK) and estimation of
              allele frequency, RNA abundance (e.g., TopHat2/Cufflink), or DNA
              copy numbers (e.g., Sequenza). In addition, optimized pipelines
              for the clinical sequencing from cell-free DNA or miR-Seq are
              also provided. The processed data were transformed into R

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) early in
              the course of type 2 diabetes acutely improves beta-cell function
              with long-lasting effects on glycemic control. However,
              conventional measures cannot determine which patients are better
              suited for IIT, and little is known about the molecular
              mechanisms determining response. Therefore, this study aimed to
              develop a model that could accurately predict the response to IIT
              and provide insight into molecular mechanisms driving such
              response in humans. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with early type
              2 diabetes were assessed at baseline and four weeks after IIT,
              consisting of basal detemir and premeal insulin aspart. Twelve
              individuals had a beneficial beta-cell response to IIT
              (responders) and 12 did not (nonresponders). Beta-cell function
              was assessed by multiple methods, including Insulin
              Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were profiled
              in plasma samples before and after IIT. The response to IIT was
              modeled using a machine learning algorithm and potential
              miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms assessed by differential
              expression, correlation, and functional network analyses (FNA).
              RESULTS: Baseline levels of circulating miR-145-5p, miR-29c-3p,
              and HbA1c accurately (91.7\%) predicted the response to IIT (OR =
              121 [95\% CI: 6.7, 2188.3]). Mechanistically, a previously
              described regulatory loop between miR-145-5p and miR-483-3p/5p,
              which controls TP53-mediated apoptosis, appears to also occur in
              our study population of humans with early type 2 diabetes. In
              addition, significant (fold change > 2, P 0.4, P < 0.05) with the
              changes in measures of beta-cell function and insulin
              sensitivity. FNA identified a network of
              coordinately/cooperatively regulated miRNA-targeted genes that
              potentially drives the IIT response through negative regulation
              of apoptotic processes that underlie beta cell dysfunction and
              concomitant positive regulation of proliferation. CONCLUSIONS:
              Responses to IIT in people with early type 2 diabetes are
              associated with characteristic miRNA signatures. This study
              represents a first step to identify potential responders to IIT
              (a current limitation in the field) and provides important
              insight into the pathophysiologic determinants of the

              response to 1M NaCl, reflecting the decrease in ribosome
              biogenesis and translation that often accompanies stress. The 64
              up-regulated proteins included central metabolic enzymes required
              for glycerol synthesis, a key osmolyte for this yeast, as well as
              proteins with functions during stress. These data reinforce the
              view that adaptation to salt stress involves a transient
              reduction in ribosome biogenesis and translation together with
              the accumulation of the osmolyte, glycerol. The specificity of
              the response to salt stress is highlighted by the small
              proportion of quantified C. albicans proteins (5\%) whose
              relative elevated abundances were statistically significant.",

              have now been performed for many types of cancer. However, most
              studies have focused on deregulation at the gene-level, which may
              overlook the alterations of specific transcripts for a given
              gene. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the
              best-characterized and most pervasive renal cancers, and ccRCCs
              are well-documented to have aberrant RNA processing. In the

              RNA expression by reporting a comprehensive transcript-level

              investigating coding and non-coding differential transcript
              expression in ccRCC. We analyzed 50 ccRCC tumors and their

              identified 7,339 differentially expressed transcripts and 94

              competitively inhibits dioxygenase enzymes, causing activation of
              pseudohypoxic signaling and hypermethylation of histones and DNA.
              The mechanisms by which these alterations lead to tumorigenesis
              are unclear, however. In an effort to fundamentally understand
              how SDH loss reprograms cell biology, we developed an
              immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line with
              conditional disruption of Sdhc and characterize the kinetics of
              Sdhc gene rearrangement, SDHC protein loss, succinate

  author   = "Abrahamian, Melania and Kagda, Meenakshi and Ah-Fong, Audrey M V

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An important feature of eukaryotic evolution is
              metabolic compartmentalization, in which certain pathways are
              restricted to the cytosol or specific organelles. Glycolysis in
              eukaryotes is described as a cytosolic process. The universality
              of this canon has been challenged by recent genome data that
              suggest that some glycolytic enzymes made by stramenopiles bear
              mitochondrial targeting peptides. RESULTS: Mining of oomycete,
              diatom, and brown algal genomes indicates that stramenopiles
              encode two forms of enzymes for the second half of glycolysis,
              one with and the other without mitochondrial targeting peptides.
              The predicted mitochondrial targeting was confirmed by using
              fluorescent tags to localize phosphoglycerate kinase,
              phosphoglycerate mutase, and pyruvate kinase in Phytophthora
              infestans, the oomycete that causes potato blight. A genome-wide
              search for other enzymes with atypical mitochondrial locations
              identified phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, phosphoserine
              aminotransferase, and phosphoserine phosphatase, which form a
              pathway for generating serine from the glycolytic intermediate
              3-phosphoglycerate. Fluorescent tags confirmed the delivery of
              these serine biosynthetic enzymes to P. infestans mitochondria. A
              cytosolic form of this serine biosynthetic pathway, which occurs
              in most eukaryotes, is missing from oomycetes and most other
              stramenopiles. The glycolysis and serine metabolism pathways of
              oomycetes appear to be mosaics of enzymes with different
              ancestries. While some of the noncanonical oomycete mitochondrial
              enzymes have the closest affinity in phylogenetic analyses with
              proteins from other stramenopiles, others cluster with bacterial,
              plant, or animal proteins. The genes encoding the mitochondrial
              phosphoglycerate kinase and serine-forming enzymes are physically
              linked on oomycete chromosomes, which suggests a shared origin.
              CONCLUSIONS: Stramenopile metabolism appears to have been shaped
              through the acquisition of genes by descent and lateral or
              endosymbiotic gene transfer, along with the targeting of the
              proteins to locations that are novel compared to other
              eukaryotes. Colocalization of the glycolytic and serine
              biosynthesis enzymes in mitochondria is apparently necessary
              since they share a common intermediate. The results indicate that
              descriptions of metabolism in textbooks do not cover the full
              diversity of eukaryotic biology.",

              of coding and noncoding RNAs in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana
              shifted from replete to deficient phosphorous (Pi) nutrition.
              Homodirectional changes in steady-state mRNA abundance and
              translation were observed for all but 265 annotated
              protein-coding genes. Of the translationally regulated mRNAs,
              30\% had one or more upstream ORF (uORF) that influenced the
              number of ribosomes on the principal protein-coding region.
              Nearly one-half of the 2,382 lncRNAs detected had ribosome
              footprints, including 56 with significantly altered translation
              under Pi-limited nutrition. The prediction of translated small
              ORFs (sORFs) by quantitation of translation termination and

              including several deeply evolutionarily conserved and

              that natural antisense transcripts (NATs) frequently have

              up-regulation that correlated with enhanced translation of the

              antigen-presenting cells are initial targets of Zaire ebolavirus

              monocytes and macrophages results in the production of
              inflammatory mediators, which may cause lymphocyte apoptosis.
              However, these findings have not been corroborated by in vivo
              studies. In this study, we report the first longitudinal analysis
              of transcriptional changes in purified monocytes, T-cells, and
              B-cells isolated from cynomolgus macaques following infection
              with ZEBOV-Makona. Our data reveal monocytes as one of the major
              immune cell subsets that supports ZEBOV replication in vivo. In
              addition, we report a marked increase in the transcription of
              genes involved in inflammation, coagulation, and vascular disease
              within monocytes, suggesting that monocytes contribute to EVD
              manifestations. Further, genes important for antigen presentation
              and regulation of immunity were downregulated, potentially
              subverting development of adaptive immunity. In contrast,
              lymphocytes, which do not support ZEBOV replication, showed
              transcriptional changes limited to a small number of
              interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and a failure to upregulate
              genes associated with an antiviral effector immune response.
              Collectively, these data suggest that ZEBOV-infected monocytes
              play a significant role in ZEBOV-Makona pathogenesis and
              strategies to suppress virus replication or modify innate

              Reactivation of VZV results in herpes zoster, a debilitating and
              painful disease. It is believed that VZV reactivates due to a
              decline in cell-mediated immunity; however, the roles that CD4
              versus CD8 T cells play in the prevention of herpes zoster remain
              poorly understood. To address this question, we used a
              well-characterized model of VZV infection where rhesus macaques
              are intrabronchially infected with the homologous simian
              varicella virus (SVV). Latently infected rhesus macaques were
              thymectomized and depleted of either CD4 or CD8 T cells to induce
              selective senescence of each T cell subset. After T cell
              depletion, the animals were transferred to a new housing room to
              induce stress. SVV reactivation (viremia in the absence of rash)
              was detected in three out of six CD8-depleted and two out of six
              CD4-depleted animals suggesting that both CD4 and CD8 T cells
              play a critical role in preventing SVV reactivation. Viral loads
              in multiple ganglia were higher in reactivated animals compared
              to non-reactivated animals. In addition, reactivation results in
              sustained transcriptional changes in the ganglia that enriched to
              gene ontology and diseases terms associated with neuronal
              function and inflammation indicative of potential damage as a
              result of viral reactivation. These studies support the critical
              role of cellular immunity in preventing varicella virus
              reactivation and indicate that reactivation results in
              long-lasting remodeling of the ganglia transcriptome.",
