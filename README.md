## Prerequisites and Installation

### Install {[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)} and [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)

#### {[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)}

```r
installed.packages("rstudio/blogdown")
# If anything wrong try develop version
remotes::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```
#### Hugo

You need a recent extended version (we recommend version 0.79.0 or later) of Hugo 
to do local builds and previews of sites that use Docsy.

It is recommended to install `Hugo` from R for working with {blogdown}

```r
blogdown::install_hugo(extended = TRUE)
```
or from commandline

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.79.0/hugo_extended_0.79.0_Linux-64bit.deb
sudo dpkg -i  hugo_extended_0.79.0_Linux-64bit.deb 
hugo version
```

For `Windows` and `macOS` please see instructions [here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/). 

#### Install PostCSS


To build or update your site's CSS resources, you also need `PostCSS` to create the final assets. If you need to install it, you must have a recent version of `NodeJS` installed on your machine so you can use `npm`, the Node package manager. By default `npm` installs tools under the directory where you run `npm` install:

```bash
sudo npm install -D autoprefixer
sudo npm install -D postcss-cli
# Starting in version 8 of postcss-cli, you must also separately install postcss:

sudo npm install -D postcss

# go to your website directory
cd <repository_name>
npm audit fix
```

### Run the website locally 

#### with {blogdown}

* Open R in console or Rstudio

This repo contains a `.Rprofile` file that will automatically serve the site
for you R starting directory is this newly cloned repository. Otherwise, 
change working directory to the repository and run:

```r
blogdown::serve_site()
```

You should see a website is opened in your local browser or Rstudio viewer.

#### Run the website locally on the terminal

```bash
cd YOUR_NEW_REPO_PATH
hugo server
```

## Create your website content

This Docsy Template Project uses the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme, and we have provided a skeleton documentation structure for you to use when you clone the repo. The full documentation can be found [here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/deployment/).

One example Rmarkdown file, */content/en/docs/test.Rmarkdown* is also included in the skeleton. 

1. To modify website content, after running `blogdown::serve_site()`, change files in `/content/en` directory. 

2. > **_Important:_** To work with the RMarkdown files, change file extension from `.Rmd` to `.Rmarkdown` extension, e.g. `tutorial.Rmakdown`.
The `.Rmd` files may still work but one of the issues includes lack of R code highlighting. 

2.1 When you are writing the Rmarkdown files, you try to aviod the H1 heading or single `#` in R markdown as section titles. This theme assumes only one
H1 heading which used in document title. Other additional H1 heading will be displayed but will **not show up on the Table of Centent**.

3. When you save your modified Rmarkdown files, {blogdown} will automatically render the file to `.markdown` extension. This
new `.markdown` will be used by Hugo to generate HTML. 

4. After the `.markdown` generation, changes will be reflected in the local browser in a second. 

### Adding Content

* [Content sections and templates](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/content/#content-section)

* [Navigation and Search](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/navigation/#top-level-menu)

* [Adding a version drop-down](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/versioning/)

  * Edit the `/config.toml`:
  
```yaml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "GitHub"
    weight = 1
    url = "https://github.com/dcassol/docsy_Rmarkdown"
[[menu.main]]
  name = "Reference"
  url = "/docs/reference/"
  parent = "GitHub"
  weight = 1
```

## Build the website

If you are ready to publish the website, use
```r
blogdown::build_site()
```
All website content is in the `/public` folder. Only this folder is required to publish your website.

Read [deploy](#deploy) for some convenient ways we provide to publish the website.

* Add documentation for the custom configuration.

## Deploy

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

Key feature: Fully automatic, **no need to build website locally**. Yes, you can skip `blogdown::build_site()` step locally.

#### 1. Add all R and system packages to `/deps.yaml` file that are required to render your `Rmarkdown` files

* Specify any CRAN, Bioconductor or Github packages you have used, in `yaml` array format. Github packages need to be `user_name/repo_name`.
* The site building is happening on Github by an Ubuntu system, so specify any system packages to install that are required by your R packages. Only a single line, use space to separate each system dependencies.

#### 2. Change base URL in config file

Change your `baseURL` in the `/config.toml`. 

* If this is your first github website, change the baseURL = "/" to your github base `url`, like "`https://USERNAME.github.io/`".
* If not, baseURL = "/" to your repo's url, like "`https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/`".
* If you use custom domain, baseURL = "/" to your custom url, like "`https://MY_DOMAIN_NAME.com/`".

#### 3. Create a new branch named `gh-pages`

```
git checkout -b gh-pages
rm -rv !(.git|README.md)
git add . && git commit -m "gh-pages" && git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
git checkout main
git add . && git commit -m "pg_build" && git push
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Or go to Github website create a branch by [clicking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).

You do *not* need to push any content to this `gh-pages` branch. This branch is automatically managed by Github Actions. 

#### 4. Github Setting 

* Click on **Setting**
* click on **GitHub Pages** 
* Select Branch *gh-pages* and folder */(root)* and click on **Save**
* Click on **Enforce HTTPS** 

#### 5. Trigger page build

* To trigger a build and deployment event, in the `git commit` message, include the word "**pg_build**", 
e.g. `git commit -m "blabla pg_build"`. This will run the full rendering process (rendering and deploy the website may still take a few minutes).
* If you have build the site locally and updated the `/public` locally, in your commit message, include the word "**no_render**" will skip the site rendering + build process. Github Actions will directly use `/public` to host the website.

#### Details

* The first deployment can take some time because Github Actions need to install these packages. 
After first successful deployment with Github Actions, all packages will be cached and 
no need to install again later. So later deployment will be much faster.

 
## Deploy to Netlify

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2de20eae-a002-40ef-8c96-1fe54f9528d4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/docsy-rmarkdown/deploys)

**_Important:_** :

1. Before running `blogdown::build_site()`, in `/config.toml` change `baseURL` to "/" `baseURL="/"`
1. Before deployment, in `/netlify.toml` change `publish` to "public" `publish = "public"`

## Common Problems

### 1. During site building: 

`Error: Error building site: POSTCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.css" (text/css):resource "scss/scss/main.scss_4853eb546e7a6c0898ed71feae7357c0" not found in file cache`.

```bash
cd YOUR_REPO
npm audit fix
```
More [information](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/235)

### 2. During site building: 

`Error: Error building site: "~/content/en/_index.html:6:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "blocks/cover" not found`.

```bash
cd YOUR_REPO
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Rmarkdown rendering
```r
The extension tex_math_dollars is not supported for gfm
Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 23
Execution halted
Error : Failed to render content/en/docs/test.Rmarkdown
```
Update pandoc >= 2.12 solves the problem. Use `rmarkdown::pandoc_version()` to check version.

If you use Rstudio, simply update Rstudio to the latest version which comes with pandoc >= 2.12 and 
rmarkdown will use it automatically. Otherwise, you need to [update pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) by yourself.
